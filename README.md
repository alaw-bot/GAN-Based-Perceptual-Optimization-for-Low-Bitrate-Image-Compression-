ðŸ”¥ GAN-Based Image Compression with Saliency-Aware Bit Allocation
This project implements a GAN-based image compression system that leverages MobileNetV2-based saliency maps to prioritize perceptually important regions. The architecture uses an encoder generator discriminator setup and compresses images into a compact latent representation with intelligent, saliency-weighted bit allocation.

ðŸ§  Key Features
âœ… End-to-End Image Compression using deep convolutional encoder and decoder (generator)

âœ… GAN Training with PatchGAN discriminator for realistic reconstructions

âœ… Saliency-Aware Compression: Uses MobileNetV2 to compute saliency maps, guiding attention and bit allocation

âœ… Perceptual Loss: Uses VGG19 for perceptual quality enhancement

âœ… Binary Compression: Stores latent vectors as binary .npy files

âœ… Colab Friendly: One-click run on Google Colab with minimal setup
